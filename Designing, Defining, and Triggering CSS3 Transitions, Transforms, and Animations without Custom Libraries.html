<h1>Transitions</h1>
<p>
The XmlHttpRequest object is supported in Internet Explorer 7. It is available in window property of the IE browser. Using this object, you can make XML requests 
via HTTP. This object is the back-bone of the Microsoft AJAX (Asynchronous Java and XML) technology to perform callbacks to the server on clients' request.</br>
With the XMLHttpRequest object, Microsoft Internet Explorer clients can retrieve and submit XML data directly to a Web server without reloading the page. On receiving 
XML content from the server, you can convert XML data into readable HTML content, using the client-side XML DOM or XSLT.</p>
</p>
<p>
<h1>Transforms</h1>
<p>XmlHttpRequest  object can be used to call even the web service methods. In the open method of the object, set the async flag as true; set the onreadystatechange 
property to a function. When you make a request to the webservice method asynchronously, the function you specified is called back by XmlHttpRequest reporting the 
status of the request. In this callback method, you can pass the input parameters for the web service method and invoke the method to get the results.</br>
The HTML5 audio element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.</br>
Again, you can either use a local file or a URL.

<h1>Animations</h1>
<p>The canvas tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).</br>
The canvas tag is only a container for graphics, you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.</p>
<p>By default, the canvas tag is just a rectangular area on an html page without border or content.  There are countless options for formatting a canvas element.</p>
